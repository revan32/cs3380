Running a lawn care business can become very exhausting. Maintaining up-to-date contact information, schedules, a job history and accounting data all in one central and common place is very difficult, and it gets even more challenging as the size of your business grows.  There are many options to recording all of this data. I have tried bringing notebooks on the job and writing down the information as I go from place to place. The physical toll on these paper notebooks eventually adds up from the dirt, sweat, and tossing around, and your notebooks often end up unreadable. I’ve tried writing the information down on paper on the job, and then recopying the data into spreadsheets on a computer after the fact. The redundancy in this process is often annoying, and setting up full-scale spreadsheets to work with your data can be too challenging in itself.  An attempt at a mobile spreadsheet app was also made, but trying to tap tiny cells on a small screen while you’re on the go is near impossible.  The closest thing I ever got to an adequately useful system was a mobile app designed to track bank accounts, or, for me, client accounts. It allowed for dated entries of “money transactions,” which I of course used to represent job instances.  Even still, there was an obvious feature gap between what this app provided and what was ideal and useful for my needs. There is definitely opportunity for a fully functioning app that directly addresses these issues in an efficient manner.
