   The thing I remember the most about cutting grass was the heat. My face would be baking and I felt like I was walking around in an oven. I remember thinking that it should be against basic human rights to have to work in conditions where the heat index was over 100 degrees. My dad made me cut the grass. Another thought I had was that I wondered how much all the grass would weigh if, when I cut it, it went straight to one place instead of getting scattered over the lawn again. Raking was a miserable process. I always worked for free because it was as a kid it was one of my chores. Looking back, I would like to know how much money I would have made if, for instance, I was getting paid $10 an hour. It would make me reconsider whether or not I should have starting cutting other peopleâ€™s lawns for money.
