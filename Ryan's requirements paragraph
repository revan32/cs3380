     When I was a kid my dad would do yardwork on the side as an extra way to make
money. It wasn't too much work for him however, as he would normally bring my brother
and I along for extra help. He would give us each $10 for helping him because due to
us moving the lawn, getting rid of weeds, and edging the grass we were paid enough
for him to do so. Overtime, I noticed that he would always have trouble remembering
when he did a job or when his next job was, so he would have a pin-up board in the
garage that was covered top to bottom with sticky notes. My dad would need to be
reminded by something he would see often, so he had the board put up just on the other
side of the garage door so he'd always see it. This is why he didn't use a ledger because
he feared he would never remember to look at it. Now that technology has evolved and the
majority of people have smartphones with things like push-notifications, the "out of sight,
out of mind" excuse can be thrown out the window. You can have an app that would keep track
of jobs done and always remind you when you have an upcoming job ahead of time. If only my
dad had something like this ten years ago, it would've saved him numerous headaches trying
to decipher the puzzle that was his "Job Reminder Board."
